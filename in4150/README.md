# CS4545 Distributed Algorithms Lab
![course header](img/course_header.jpeg)

This code is offered as a template for the course CS4545.
This template is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (should also work on Windows and Mac OSX).
NOTE: When running locally Python >= 3.8  is required.

## Docs

- IPv8 ([ipv8-docs](https://py-ipv8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)).
- Asyncio ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)) is heavily used for the implementation of this code.

## File structure
- **cs4545:** Holds all the python source files
- **cs4545/ implementation:** Contains code for different distributed algorithms
- **topologies/default.yaml:** List of the addresses of all the processes that are participating in the algorithm.
- **Dockerfile:** Dockerfile describing the image that is used by docker-compose
- **docker-compose.yml:** Yaml file that describes the system for docker-compose.
- **docker-compose.template.yml:** Yaml file used as a template for the `src/util.py` script.

## Topology File
The topology file (in `./topologies`) is used to define how the nodes in the system are connected.
The yaml file is a list of node ids with the corresponding connections to other nodes.
To increase the number of nodes in a topology, run the `util.py` script.
By default, `util.py` creates a ring topology. If you want/need to use another topology (fully-connected, parse network, ...), adjust the script.
To run the util script `python -m cs4545.system.util compose <num-nodes> <topology-file> <algorithm-name>`



## Remarks

1. Feel free to change any of the files. This template is offered as starting point with working messaging between distributed processes.
2. Be sure to adjust the topology based on the assignment. By default, `util.py` creates a ring topology. If you want/need to use another topology (fully-connected, parse network, ...), adjust the script.


## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker-compose
- (Python >= 3.8 if running locally)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Expected output is the same as when running with docker-compose.

## Examples Docker

### Echo algorithm

```bash
python -m cs4545.system.util compose 2 topologies/echo.yaml echo --overwrite_topology
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## Errors F.A.Q.

- **PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'output/...**
This can happen if you run docker first and then run locally. The docker daemon uses root access and can alter the ownership of some folders.
On Linux/Macos you can change the folder ownership with `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER output`.
- **ERROR: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space***
There already exists a docker network with the same network space. Try removing a docker network using `docker network rm [network_name]` or change the address space in the file `docker-compose.template.yml`
